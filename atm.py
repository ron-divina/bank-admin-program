# SECTION I - Class Definitions

# 1. This is "atm.py", and put all succeeding class definitions in this file.

# 2. Create a base class, DepositAccount, containing attributes: account_id, account_type, full_name, birthday, balance, and maintaining_balance


class DepositAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_id, account_type, full_name, birthday, balance):
        self.account_id = account_id
        self.account_type = account_type
        self.full_name = full_name
        self.birthday = birthday
        self.balance = balance
        self.maintaining_balance = 0

    def display_info(self):
        from datetime import datetime, date

        if self.account_type == 'NSA':
            self.account_type = 'Normal Savings Account'
        elif self.account_type == 'ZMSA':
            self.account_type = 'Zero Maintaining Savings Account'
        elif self.account_type == 'SSA':
            self.account_type = 'Super Savings Account'

        birth_date = datetime.strptime(self.birthday, "%B %d, %Y")
        today = date.today()
        age = today.year - birth_date.year - \
            ((today.month, today.day) < (birth_date.month, birth_date.day))

        balance_readable_format = "â‚±{:,.2f}".format(self.balance)

        return f"""

        Account Type: {self.account_type}
        Age: {age}
        Balance: {balance_readable_format}

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount


class NormalSavingsAccount(DepositAccount):
    def __init__(self, account_id, account_type, full_name, birthday, balance):
        super().__init__(account_id, account_type, full_name, birthday, balance)
        self.maintaining_balance = 3000

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance < 3000:
            self.balance -= amount
            self.balance -= 100
        else:
            self.balance -= amount


d1 = NormalSavingsAccount(1, 'NSA', 'Ron Divina', 'August 10, 1999', 2000)
d1.withdraw(100)
print(d1.display_info())
# d1.withdraw(25000)
# print(d1.display_info())

# The base class should have the following function "display_info" which prints the account information in the following format:

# Account ID: [account id]
# Full Name: [full name]
# Account Type: [account type in readable format, * see details below]
# Age: [computed age based on birthday]
# Balance: [balance in readable format, ** see details below]


# * - Deposit Account Types:
# NSA = Normal Savings Account
# ZMSA = Zero Maintaining Savings Account
# SSA = Super Savings Account

# ** - Balance in readable format should be in P#,###.## e.g. P5,423,523.80

# E.g.

# Account ID: ph-342851
# Full Name: Juan Dela Cruz
# Account Type: Zero Maintaining Savings Account
# Age: 29
# Balance: P65,536.00


# The base class should also have the following functions, "withdraw" and "deposit" which accepts the parameter "amount"

# For the withdraw function, you should subtract the amount from the current balance.

# For the deposit function, you should add the amount to the current balance.


# 3. For each deposit account, create a child class which inherits from DepositAccount class:
# - NormalSavingsAccount for Normal Savings Account
# - ZeroMaintainingSavingsAccount for Zero Maintaining Savings Account
# - SuperSavingsAccount for Super Savings Account

# NormalSavingsAccount class should set the attribute maintaining_balance to 3000 and should override the "withdraw" function. Apply the withdraw logic from the description:
# - If the user withdraws money and if the balance is below P3,000, the system will deduct P100 on top of the withdrawn amount, and will display a warning, "Warning: Account is below maintaining balance.").

# ZeroMaintainingSavingsAccount class should set the attribute maintaining_balance to 0 and should override the "withdraw" function. Apply the logic from the description:
# - Withdrawal fee is P12 i.e. the system will deduct P12 on top of the withdrawn amount each time the user withdraws money.

# SuperSavingsAccount class should set the attribute maintaining_balance to 100000 and should override the "withdraw" function. Apply the logic from the description:
# - If the user withdraws money and if the balance is below P100,000, the system will deduct P100 on top of the withdrawn amount, and will display a warning that it's below maintaining.

# SuperSavingsAccount class should also override the "deposit" function and apply the logic from the description:
# - Every time the user deposits money, there's a bonus of 2% on top of the deposited amount. E.g. if the user deposits P10,000 the system will add a bonus of P200.

# 4. Create a class "AccountDatabase" which has an attribute "accounts" which is an list / array that will contain DepositAccount objects. You may add more attributes and functions as you see fit to complete the rest of the requirements.
